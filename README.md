## Overview

This project is the fron-end part of a fullstasck project.

## Front Project Structure

The project follows a specific directory structure to organize the client-side code. Here's an overview of the directory structure:

```.
├─── css
│     └── styles.css
├─── js
│     ├── admin.js
│     └── index.js
├── media
│     └── (all the assets content)
├── admin.html
├── index.html
└── README.md
```


## Deployment

The deploy is currently not available at the moment, but here is a testing video of the fullstack project.

(video will be here soon)


## Conclusion

The idea behind Speaker was to create a simulated TED talk project, primarily focusing on building the backend with Java and establishing the necessary connections to make it a fullstack application where anybody can suscribe to give a talk and then an admin part where the people who have access can edit and track the susbcribers.
